# WIS Career Dashboard - Setup Instructions

## Overview

The WIS Career Dashboard is a web-based tool for managing career data in the `wis.json` file. It uses GitHub's API to read and write data directly to the repository, ensuring all changes are version-controlled.

## One-Time Setup (Per Team Member)

### Step 1: Generate GitHub Personal Access Token

1. **Go to GitHub Settings:**
   - Navigate to: [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
   - Or: Click your profile → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)

2. **Generate New Token:**
   - Click **"Generate new token (classic)"**
   - Note: `WIS Career Dashboard`
   - Expiration: `90 days` (or choose custom duration)

3. **Select Scopes:**
   - Check **✓ repo** (Full control of private repositories)
   - This is the only scope needed

4. **Generate and Copy:**
   - Click **"Generate token"** at the bottom
   - **IMPORTANT:** Copy the token immediately - you won't be able to see it again!
   - It should start with `ghp_`

### Step 2: Access the Dashboard

1. **Navigate to the Dashboard:**
   - URL: [https://rmit-ve-learningexperience.github.io/dmd/wis_demo/admin.html](https://rmit-ve-learningexperience.github.io/dmd/wis_demo/admin.html)

2. **Paste Your Token:**
   - On first visit, you'll see a setup screen
   - Paste your GitHub token into the input field
   - Click **"Save Token"**

3. **Verification:**
   - The dashboard will verify your token with GitHub
   - If successful, you'll see the career management interface
   - If there's an error, check that:
     - Token is correct (starts with `ghp_`)
     - Token has `repo` scope
     - Token hasn't expired

### Step 3: You're Ready!

- Your token is stored securely in your browser's local storage
- You can now view, edit, add, and delete careers
- All changes are committed directly to GitHub

- When expired, you'll see an "Invalid token" error
- Generate a new token and paste it in the setup screen

### Logout
- Click **"Logout"** in the top-right to clear your token from the browser
- You'll need to paste your token again next time
- Use this on shared computers

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid token" Error

**Possible causes:**
- Token expired
- Token doesn't have `repo` scope
- Typo when pasting token

**Solution:**
1. Go to [GitHub Settings → Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Delete old token
3. Generate new token with `repo` scope
4. Copy and paste new token in dashboard

### "Failed to load career data" Error

**Possible causes:**
- Network connection issue
- GitHub API rate limit exceeded
- Repository permissions changed

**Solution:**
1. Check your internet connection
2. Wait a few minutes and try again
3. Verify you have access to the repository

### Changes Not Appearing

**Possible causes:**
- Browser cache showing old version
- Concurrent edits by another team member

**Solution:**
1. Hard refresh browser: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
2. Check [GitHub commits](https://github.com/RMIT-VE-LearningExperience/dmd/commits/main) to verify your change
3. If conflict, coordinate with team member

### Can't Save Changes

**Possible causes:**
- Validation errors
- Missing required fields
- Network error

**Solution:**
1. Scroll up to see validation error messages (red box)
2. Fix all errors listed
3. Ensure all required fields (marked with *) are filled
4. Try saving again

### Validation Errors

The dashboard will show a red box with specific errors. Common ones:

- `"Salary must be in format: $XX,XXX - $XX,XXX"` → Fix salary format
- `"At least one core skill is required"` → Add at least 1 skill
- `"At least 2 career levels are required"` → Add more levels
- `"Career name already exists"` → Choose a different name

## Best Practices

### Before Making Changes
1. **Communicate with team:** Let others know you're editing
2. **Pull latest changes:** Refresh the page to see recent updates
3. **Make small, focused changes:** Edit one career at a time

### When Editing
1. **Use clear, descriptive names:** Avoid abbreviations
2. **Follow existing patterns:** Match format of other careers
3. **Double-check salary ranges:** Ensure realistic and properly formatted
4. **Keep overviews concise:** 1-2 sentences, focus on key information
5. **Use consistent skill names:** Check existing skills before adding new ones

### After Saving
1. **Verify the commit:** Check [GitHub commits](https://github.com/RMIT-VE-LearningExperience/dmd/commits/main)
2. **Test on live site:** Visit careers explorer to see changes
3. **Hard refresh if needed:** `Ctrl+Shift+R` to clear cache

## Workflow for Monthly Updates

### Recommended Process

3. **Make changes:**
   - Open dashboard
   - Edit one career at a time
   - Save after each career (creates separate commits)

4. **Verify changes:**
   - Check GitHub for commits
   - Test careers explorer page
   - Verify quiz still works with new data

5. **Document changes:**
   - Optional: Add summary of changes in team chat
   - Note any new skills or work styles added
